Konnichiwarguan legends; Private Lessons are back! Lessons can focus on any area of music production or creative methodology, and can be tailored for any skill level (unless you're better at tunes than me, which could be sick tbh lmao).

Simply send an email to lessons@blatwax.com - along with your areas of interest (ie. sound design, mixing, neuro bass, tips on finding the best bomboclaat samples) and I'll respond with a link to the Discord and some follow up questions so we can figure out what works best.

Prices are verbally means tested because I'm a filthy socialist. Standard rate is $50 AUD for 1 Hour, but if you're doing it tough, please let me know and I'll see what I can offer. Hell yeah, bredren.
